As time went on this bot grew in complexity and demands. Well executed: -Creation of a fun discord bot with features such as auto generated word games to earn currency, math puzzles, and currency drops. -By testing this bot in a server full of CS students, I was able to learn by avoiding many accidental vulerabilities, and I got to see how an end user might try and break something like this Missed value: -Due to lacking knowledge of the eventual scope of this project, A robust databasing system was never implemented. Instead it relied heavily on json parsing libraries, and had little redundancy -The rapidly evolving state of this bot lead to a generally un-functionalized program, which could use some breaking up Lessons Learned: -If you\u0026#39;ll be storing data, go with a robust DB from the beginning -Especially when interacting with large services such as discord, it is important to have fallback mechanisms and completion checks -Planning for future development requires limiting your design ideas in the beginning Notes: This was a great fun hobby project I\u0026#39;d love to continue working on, however I don\u0026#39;t use discord much these days. Instead i\u0026#39;ll look to other bots to make Arcade Dungeon Crawler (2020) 1 2 3 4 5 6 7 8 9 10 11 12 13 14 15 16 17 18 19 20 21 22 23 24 25 26 27 28 29 30 31 32 33 34 35 Context: https://github.com/csjoey/Dungeon_game_client For my first college computer science class I had the oppurtunity thanks to an amazing teacher, to make a game as a final project. I ended up working with a classmate of mine who had a similar programming backgroung before the class started, and though mistakes were made, I learned alot Well executed: -Proceedural generation of a dungeon crawler using the Arcade library for python. This used a sha-256 based seed to compute general room layout and enemies. -Worked together successfully with my teammate, and gained valuable experience in co-programming and mutually designing software Missed value: -A big minus on this one due to my inexperience in python at the time, I ended up completely misusing the idea of classes in python. This is somewhat embarrasing looking back, but I\u0026#39;m proud to be able to see my mistakes now, and hey, at least I had the right idea -As part of the challenge of mutual design between ametuers, some of the code for screen drawing and hit registration is uglier than i\u0026#39;d like. A lot uglier; but not bad for two college freshmen since it does work. Lessons Learned: -Drawing out functionality of complex system helps communication -Co-programming is a valuabe tool for fast productivity in teams -When designing software, looking to open source analogous projects can be a valuable source for a community that has refined best practices for a particlar language. Notes: I was very proud at the time that I was a freshman that this got done, and my partner was very enjoyable to work with. Looking back on this I see it as a reminder to always search for ways to be better, I hope I look back on my work I do now the way I look at this project ","date":"0001-01-01T00:00:00Z","permalink":"https://josephloporto.com/p/doneproj/","title":"Reflection on past projects"},{"content":"Job Search 1 2 Open to hiring oppurtunities, working on updating the website to better reflect my skills and current intrests.

Welcome to my personal website! :) my name is Joseph Loporto. I frequently experiment with new technologes, and am always looking for ways to improve my skills and know-how. 

This website was created with the Stack hugo theme under the MIT license. Source code is available for now at my github: https://github.com/csjoey/

An oracle cloud always free instance configured with oracle linux running nginx functions as this sites static backend.

Please take a look around, and get in contact with me if something should pique your intrest.
